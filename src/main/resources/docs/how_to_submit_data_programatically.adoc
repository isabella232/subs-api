== Overview

This document will take you through the steps required to submit descriptive data (often called "metadata") using the
https://www.ebi.ac.uk[EMBL-EBI] submission system. EMBL-EBI provide a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS[hypermedia]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST API] to accept descriptive data from submitters using
standard HTTP requests.

The examples in this walkthrough use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL[curl] to interact with the server, but you can
use the API with any programming language.

== Log in

*TODO* we will add a section describing how to get an authorisation token and what to do with it.

== Fetch the API root

We recommend that clients start from the root endpoint and follow the _links_ given in the `_links` section of the
response, instead of hard-coding each API endpoint. This will future proof against future changes to URL structure
within the submission system.

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a long list of links, in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL JSON] format:

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/http-response.adoc[]

You don't need to worry about most of those links for now, we'll learn about them as we go.

== Pick a team

Every submission is owned by a _team_. A team is a group At this stage of development, the API doesn't restrict what team you use.
A future update will add support for team membership and administration. Until then, you can use any team name you like.

A team object is structured like this:

`{"name" : "my-team"}`

At present, you also need to provide a submitter object when creating a submission. In future versions this will be
taken from your log in information, but for now you need to provide a submitter object:

`{"email": "alice@example.com"}`

== Create a submission

Using the link labelled `submissions:create`, `POST` a document containing a team and a submitter to create
a submission:

include::{snippets}/create-submission/curl-request.adoc[]

If successful, this will return a JSON object with links to parts of the submission:

include::{snippets}/create-submission/http-response.adoc[]

The `location` header in the response has the URL for the created submission. You will need this when adding things to the submission.

== Add samples

Using the link from the submission labelled `samples:create`, `POST` a sample object:

include::{snippets}/create-sample/curl-request.adoc[]


Note that the submission field above contains the URL to the submission, this allows the records to be linked together.

This will return a response to show that the sample record has been created:

include::{snippets}/create-sample/http-response.adoc[]


=== Naming samples (and everything else)

Samples, like all the documents that you add to a submission need to have an _alias_. This field is the name used for
the record within the submission system. Each alias should be unique within the records of that type owned by a team.
Using an alias for a second time in another submission will cause the record to be overwritten.

=== Sample documents

The description of a sample should normally include a taxonomic code to describe the species classification. This should
be an entry from the taxonomy database curated at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/[NCBI]. EMBL-EBI provide a
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browse/taxonomy-service[service] to search for and look up taxonomic entries and this is used
when the submission interface checks sample documents.

We will accept sample records for display in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/[BioSamples] without a taxon ID, but
you will not be able to use the sample record when submitting data the experimental data archives without a taxon ID.

If you use a taxon ID, it must be one marked as 'submittable' in the taxonomy database.


=== Validation

Descriptive data is checked at two points during submission:

 1. When sent to the API server, through `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` requests. At this point the sent must be match the expected syntax, and be identified with an alias.
 2. Once accepted by the API server, it is sent to a suite of validators to ensure it meets the requirements of the relevant archives or project.

The second stage of validation is more in depth, and takes longer. Clients can poll for `ValidationResults` for each
submitted document, and for a submission. You will not be able to complete a submission until validation
have completed and no errors have been found.

TODO add example of getting validation results

=== Updating a sample

If you want to change a sample record after you've created it, you should use a `PUT` request to replace the record:

include::{snippets}/update-sample/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/update-sample/http-response.adoc[]

Updating a document will cause it to be re-validated, as described above.

== Adding a study

Experimental data are grouped into _studies_. Studies should describe the motivation and summarise the design for the
study. Like samples, studies are identified by an alias, and have a number of attributes.

As with samples, study records are created using `POST` requests:

TODO add a study

== Adding assays

Assay documents describes the processes performed on the sample to produce data. For example, this could be library
preparation and sequencing for an NGS study. If you are familiar with the ENA SRA submission system, an assay is equivalent to an Experiment.

TODO add an assay

== Adding assay data

If you are familiar with the ENA SRA submission system, assay data is equivalent to a Run.

TODO add assay data

== Finalising your submission

Update the submission status to 'Submitted'.

== Tracking progress

Access the status report to see how the submission


== When things go wrong

Successful requests will return a HTTP status code in `20X` range
(see the <<submission_api.adoc#_http_status_codes,reference docs>>). When something goes wrong, there will be an
error message to explain the problem. There's an explanation of each error type in the <<submission_api.adoc#_errors,reference docs>>.

Errors can normally be resolved by correcting the content or format of your request. Please get in touch if the
